♻️ **Description**:
Course Planner is a Windows Forms application that helps users manage and organize courses and their prerequisites. It allows users to add courses, set prerequisites, and perform topological sorting.

## ⚓ Features

### Course Management
- **Add Courses**: Add new courses and their prerequisites to the system. (Limited!)
- **Prerequisite Validation**: Ensure no course is its own prerequisite and prevent duplicate entries.
- **Topological Sorting**: Sort courses based on prerequisites to determine a valid course sequence.
- **Visual Indicators**: Display courses with visual markers indicating prerequisites and dependency status.

## 💎 Usage
